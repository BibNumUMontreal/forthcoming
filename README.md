# Preprints plugin for OJS 3. 

*NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS*

Preprints plugin enables a journal to preview single articles publicly before the actual issue has been published.

After enabling the plugin the Schedule for Publication form includes a selection "Show as preprint". All articles with this selection will be shown in *SITE/JOURNALNAME/forthcoming/*

Todo:
- Remove preprint flag from submission_settings upon publication of the new issue

Problems:
- how to deal with OJS statistics?
- for example pdf galley plugin has problems, because the return link is hard coded and points to the actual article page.
